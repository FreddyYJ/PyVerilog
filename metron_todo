Should I tack the submod method name to the input port name so that we don't have to dedup the ports?
  Maybe only if there's a collision?

fix #defines

check in the tracer that if we bind to a dedup'd port, we always end up with the
same expression at each port... somehow?


Tick methods must _not_ be allowed to call getters that take params





----------

assert that submodules are only bound once?
  no, they can be bound multiple times, won't break anything
submod calls can only be at toplevel?
  no, but they have to be in a compound statement so we have a place to put bindings
